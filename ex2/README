Answers to the questions:
==========================

1) If google chrome will open a new kernel level thread for 
each tab the protection and isolation of each tab from the other tabs
will not be preserved. That`s because kernel level threads share address
space with each other and processes are not. Therefore
processes are independent (a problem in a specific process does not 
effect another process) and threads are not independent. The disadvantages
of a process are: high overheads because every operation require a kernel trap. 
In addition communication between processes is complicated and expensive
(requires the operating system to communicate with each other).

2) During the command execution, the pressing on the keyboard 
caused to SIGINT interrupt to be sent from the hardware to the
operating system. Then the shell (where we wrote he command) 
sent a signal to the operating system which tell her
to start a new process and each process get a new id.
While writing the "kill" command we created a new SIGINT 
interrupt by pressing the keyboard and another interrupt
by pressing the Enter bottom who caused the execution of the line
we wrote. Finally a new SIGTERM signal is sent from the shell process
to the operating system and then it (the OS) send another signal
SIGTERM to the process we wanted to kill and it terminates that process. 


3) The difference between real time and virtual time is that 
real time refers to the real physical time in the physical world.
Virtual time is the sense of time inside of an application or informational 
model. Example for use in a real time is if we want to measure the time it
takes us to travel from Tel-Aviv to Haifa, using the "waze" application
it always gives us the time estimation it may take us to reach our destination
by giving us the exact digital hour of reaching our destination.
An Example of using virtual time is if 2 threads ran for one minute
(in the real world) in the computer and each thread ran only 30 seconds so each
thread measure the time that passed as 30 seconds because that is the time it
ran. But in the real world the time that passed is one minute.
 

4.a) When creating a new process using fork command the child process
has copies of all of its father memory segments. So the Stack,
the Heap and the Global variables are all common between the father 
and the child process. In addition those memory segments are copied to the child 
using the "copy on write" concept.


4.b) A pipe is the transferring of standard output of one program to 
another program for further processing. The pipe makes possible
the performance of some highly specialized task that none of the 
constituent programs could perform by themselves. This direct
connection between programs allows them to operate simultaneously and
permits data to be transferred between them continuously rather
than having to pass it through temporary text files.
